Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Reading Group
==========================================================


We are the machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)
reading group in the [Computer Sciences
Department](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin --
Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/).  We gather weekly during the semester to
discuss papers in the areas of ML, AI, natural language processing,
bioinformatics, and (occasionally) computer vision.  We are the primary
reading group for the [AI area](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/areas/ai/)
and cater to all its various topics, but recently ML has been the focus.


Meetings
--------

AIRG meets Wednesdays from 4-5pm in MSC 47??.


Mission
-------

The mission of AIRG is to provide a forum to

* Learn about AI and ML
* Improve ability to read and understand academic literature
* Practice critical analysis and discussion of research

We strive to accommodate differing levels of education and experience
and to provide a welcoming, accessible, open, and safe environment for
all participants.

All UW students and community members are welcome to participate in
AIRG.


Why Participate?
----------------

* It's casual.  No pressure!
* Learn about interesting and exciting science with like-minded people
* Build your academic skills (reading, analysis / criticism, writing,
  presenting)
* Get faster at reading papers
* Keep up with developments in ML and AI
* Meet your colleagues
* Satisfy your curiosity and explore new topics
* Build your résumé (presentations go down in [history](archive.yaml)!)


How it Works
------------

Each week a member [1] leads the discussion of a paper of their choice.
The member volunteers to present a paper (or other material, see below)
by contacting the coordinators.  About a week before the assigned
meeting date, the member announces [2] their paper via the mailing list.
Other members then read the paper [3] and come to the meeting prepared
to discuss it.  The volunteering member presents an overview of the
paper (about 10-20 minutes if uninterrupted) and leads the ensuing
discussion.  Questions of any kind are always welcome at any time.

[1] A member is anyone who participates!

[2] A good announcement includes a brief, motivating summary of the
    paper (usually not the abstract), a publicly-accessible permalink
    (or the PDF if a permalink to the paper is not available), and a
    reminder of the meeting time and place (especially if a "special
    session").

[3] Read the paper to the best of your ability and availability.  Skim
    it if you need to.  Read the abstract.  Glance at the figures.  Just
    show up!


How to Participate
------------------

* Be interested in AI and ML
* Be willing to delve into academic literature
* Show up to meetings (as often as you can!)
* Read papers (as best you can!)
* Lead paper discussions (optional but beneficial)
* Join the mailing list (optional but essential):
  https://lists.cs.wisc.edu/mailman/listinfo/airg.  The mailing list is
  the primary means of communication.  All readings are announced via
  the mailing list.  The list is limited to those with a `*.wisc.edu`
  e-mail address or community members that have showed up to a meeting
  and asked to sign up.


Ideas for What to Present
-------------------------

* Papers from conferences and journals (e.g. NIPS, ICML, JMLR, KDD,
  IJCAI, AAAI, IJCAI, UAI, ECML-PKDD, AISTATS, RECOMB, CVPR)
* Papers / Chapters from the [PhD qualifying exam
  list](http://aiqual.cs.wisc.edu/).  This material is always worth
  reviewing, even for advanced students.
* Papers / Chapters you have read as part of a class (especially
  appropriate for newer students to lead)
* Papers you have read for your research
* Material of personal interest and relevance to AIRG
* Slides about a paper from a talk given at a conference

The material should be short enough to discuss in an hour, although, for
longer topics, we have occasionally arranged "special sessions" that
extend the meeting time or span multiple meetings.


Coordinators
------------

* Aubrey Barnard, the Monarch of AIRG
* Ronak Mehta, the Hand of the Monarch


Archive
-------

We have an [archive](archive.yaml) (under construction) of all the AIRG
meetings going back to 2001!
