Subject: AIRG [date] confirmation

[presenter],

This confirms that you have volunteered to present at AIRG on [date].

The next steps are to choose a paper (if you haven't done so already), prepare to present and lead a discussion of it, and send out an announcement.

-----

Announcement Guidelines:

About a week before you present, please send a message to the AIRG list announcing your paper.

* Motivate reading the paper with a brief summary (a few sentences) and a description of relevance / interest. That is, market the paper; don't just send the abstract.

* Include the title, authors, venue, and a perma-link preferably to the canonical version from the publisher. Do not attach a PDF [1].

* Include a reminder of the date, time, and location. An example is below [2].

* Make the e-mail subject a good at-a-glance summary, e.g., "Graphical Lasso, 03/01". (Note that the mailing list will prepend "[AIRG] " so you don't have to mention AIRG.)

* Note that the message has to be sent from your AIRG subscription address.

I will forward your announcement as a reminder the day before or the morning of.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thank you very much for volunteering to present at AIRG!
