Subject: Lead an AIRG this semester?

Hello, [you],

Would you be willing to lead an AIRG discussion this semester? You can present anything you want that is relevant in whatever way you feel comfortable. (Have you read a paper recently? Have you presented a paper / poster? Good! Consider presenting it.) It is a good opportunity for lots of reasons (learning, collegiality, recognition, add to your CV)! For ideas and more information see https://wiscairg.github.io.

Let me know if you would be willing and when. If not, can you suggest someone else for me to ask? Thanks very much!

Aubrey
